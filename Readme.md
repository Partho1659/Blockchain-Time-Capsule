# **Blockchain Time Capsule** ðŸš€

Store messages on the blockchain and retrieve them at a specific future time. This decentralized time capsule application allows users to save messages securely and ensures they are only accessible after a predefined unlock time.

---

## **Overview**

This project is built using:

- **Solidity**: Smart contract for storing and retrieving messages.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Frontend for interacting with the smart contract.
- **Web3.js**: Connects the frontend to the blockchain.
- **MetaMask**: Ethereum wallet for sending transactions.

---

## **Features**

âœ… Store messages with a future unlock time (Epoch timestamp).  
âœ… Retrieve messages only after the unlock time has passed.  
âœ… View the total number of stored messages.  
âœ… User-friendly interface for interaction with the blockchain.

## **Prerequisites**

To run this application, you need:

1. **Node.js** installed ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/)).
2. A browser extension like **MetaMask** ([Install MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)).
3. Test Ether on a testnet (like **Goerli** or **Sepolia**) for running transactions.

## **How to Use**

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-time-capsule.git
   cd blockchain-time-capsule
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure you have MetaMask set up and connected to the correct network.

3. **Deploy the Smart Contract**  
   - Use a tool like **Remix IDE** or **Hardhat** to deploy the contract.
   - Replace the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in the frontend code with your deployed contract address.
   - Update the `CONTRACT_ABI` with the ABI of your compiled contract.

4. **Run the Application**  
   Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. Ensure MetaMask is connected and authorized.

## **Smart Contract**

The smart contract is written in Solidity and provides the following core functions:

1. **`storeMessage(string _message, uint256 _unlockTime)`**  
   Stores a message with a future unlock time.

2. **`retrieveMessage(uint256 _capsuleId)`**  
   Retrieves the stored message, but only after the unlock time has passed.

3. **`getTotalCapsules()`**  
   Returns the total number of messages stored on the blockchain.

---

## **Frontend Usage**

The frontend provides three main features:

1. **Store a Message**:  
   Enter a message and an unlock time (Epoch timestamp), then click "Store Message."

2. **Retrieve a Message**:  
   Enter the Capsule ID and click "Retrieve Message" to view the message after its unlock time.

3. **View Total Messages**:  
   Click "Get Total Capsules" to display the total number of stored messages.
